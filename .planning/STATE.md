# Project State

## Project Reference

**Building:** A high-performance CLI scraping and parsing tool for network devices in Rust

**Core Value:** Extremely fast, reliable parsing of semi-structured CLI output into structured data, regardless of whether the template is legacy TextFSM or the new ergonomic format.

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v0.1 Alpha
**Phase:** Not started (defining requirements)
**Status:** Milestone initialized, defining requirements
**Progress:** [██░░░░░░░░] 20% (Initialization + Research)

## Recent Activity

**Last session:** 2024-10-24
**What happened:**
- Completed project initialization
- Generated comprehensive research across 4 areas (Stack, Features, Architecture, Pitfalls)
- Research summary created with HIGH confidence across all areas
- Suggested 5-phase structure identified

**Current state:** Research complete, roadmap creation is the next logical step

## Research Summary

Five research documents completed:
- **STACK.md** — Rust 1.82+, tokio, ratatui, fancy-regex
- **FEATURES.md** — Table stakes and differentiators for network CLI parsing
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — IR-based design decoupling formats from execution
- **PITFALLS.md** — Common automation errors (prompt detection, silent failures)
- **SUMMARY.md** — Overall HIGH confidence, 5-phase roadmap suggested

## Pending Todos

None captured yet.

## Blockers/Concerns

None identified. Research shows HIGH confidence across all areas.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-02-17
